* Goal: Makeblock mBot robot as a platform for teaching technology, programming and robotics at school.
* Aproach: Provide a user friendly interface to a robot that moves reliable and semi-autonomous.
The robot can perfom tasks as a clerk in a warehouse driving around, picking up goods and delivering them.
