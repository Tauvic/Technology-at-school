# Intro

<img align="right" height="200" src="./images/MeLineFollowerSensor_2.png">

* Goal: Provide an easy to use robot platform to schools for teaching technology, programming and robotics.
* Aproach: Use the Makeblock mBot robot, add a user friendly interface and make it move reliable and semi-autonomous.
The robot can perfom tasks as a clerk in a warehouse driving around, picking up goods and delivering them.

# Getting started

* Get a robot
  * Buy a Makeblock mBot robot
  * Use a simulated robot ([V-REP](../V-REP))
* Programming
  * https://www.codingkids.nl/mBot-lessen.html
* Read
  * [mBlock (Scratch) & mBot "Rocks with the Robots"](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1003/6824/files/mBlock_Rocks_with_Robots_Makeblockshop_Compressed_Small.pdf?12769062248011349873)"
  * [Scratch "The Adventures of Mike"](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1003/6824/files/Scratch_2.0_The_Adventures_of_Mike_Makeblockshop_Compressed.pdf?12769062248011349873)
