* Goal: Provide an easyto use robot platform to schools for teaching technology, programming and robotics at school.
* Aproach: Use the Makeblock mBot robot, add a user friendly interface and make it move reliable and semi-autonomous.
The robot can perfom tasks as a clerk in a warehouse driving around, picking up goods and delivering them.
