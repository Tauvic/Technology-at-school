Start your journey with a simple robot (Ozobot) then continue with the more advanced types. The V-REP simulator is a 3D World simulator that can simulate robots that can also be programmed. I use [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) for designing new robot parts and test them in the simulator.

Robots:
* [Ozobot](https://ozobot.com/) basic robot with predefined moves and programming
* [Makeblock](http://www.makeblock.com/) mBot robot with basic to advanced programming
* [Poppy](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) advanced robot (Ergo Jr, Poppy Torso and Humanoid)
* [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) 3D world and robot simulator
