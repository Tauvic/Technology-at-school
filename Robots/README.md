Start your journey with a simple robot (Ozobot) then continue with the more advanced types. The V-REP simulator is a 3D World simulator that can simulate robots that can also be programmed. I use [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) for designing new robot parts and test them in the simulator.

Robots:
* Ozobot (basic robot and programming)
* Makeblock mBot (basic to advanced robot and programming)
* V-REP (robot simulator)
