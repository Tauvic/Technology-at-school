Start your journey with a simple robot (Ozobot) then continue with the more advanced types. The V-REP simulator is a 3D World simulator that can simulate robots that can also be programmed. I use [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) for designing new robot parts and test them in the simulator.

Robots:
* [Ozobot](./Ozobot) basic robot with predefined moves and programming
* [Makeblock](./Makeblock) mBot robot with basic to advanced programming
* [V-REP](./V-REP) 3D world and robot simulator
