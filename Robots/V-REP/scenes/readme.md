V-REP simulation of a differential drive robot with a 6 sensor line following array. I use this model to find out how to design a line following robot. I'm aiming for a base robot model that can be extended with add-on components. The model has been developed by Nenad StajiÄ‡ (https://github.com/NenadZG/mBot-simulation).

The base model has a frame, the computer, batteries but excludes sensors and motors. It provides mounting points for sensors and motors. Then a library of these components can be developed over time to mimic existing components and new experimental sensors. The components will also car their own code scripts and exchange information with the robot just as library functions would do. This approach will make it easy to develop clean code and keep the model simple.

For now the model supports the Orion protocol, but it could be made to also support Firmata. The model now assumes and supports only one robot in the scene , but i like two have at least two robots to see how they can interact. The interaction with shared variables or tubes should have some naming convention that includes a robot name.
